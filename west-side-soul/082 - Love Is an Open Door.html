Anna: Okay, can I just, say something crazy?
(I love crazy!)
</verse>

<verse>
All my life has been a series of doors in my face
And then suddenly I bump into you
</verse>

Hans: I was thinking the same thing! 'Cause like

I've been searching my whole life to find my own place
And maybe it's the party talking or the chocolate fondue

Anna: But with you...  (but with you)
Hans: I found my place...  (I see your face...)
Both: And it's nothing like I've ever known before!
Love is an open door!
Love is an open door!
Love is an open door!
Anna: With you!  (With you!)
Hans: With you!  (With you!)
Both: Love is an open door...

<verse>
Hans: I mean it's crazy... (What?)
We finish each other's- (Sandwiches!)

???: That's what I was gonna say!
Anna: I've never met someone-
Who thinks so much like me!
(Jinx! Jinx again!)
Our mental synchronization
Can have but one explanation

Both: You- And I- Were- Just- Meant to be!
Anna: Say goodbye...  (Say goodbye...)
Both: To the pain of the past
We don't have to feel it anymore!
Love is an open door!
Love is an open door!
Life can be so much more!

Anna: With you!  (With you!)
???: With you!  (With you!)
Both: Love is an open door...
Hans: Can I say something crazy?
Will you marry me?
Anna: Can I say something even crazier? Yes!
