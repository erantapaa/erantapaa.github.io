<h3>VERSE 1</h3>

<verse>
[Am]I took my troubles down to M[Dm]adame Ruth
[Am]You know that gypsy with the g[Dm]old-capped tooth
[C]She's got a pad down at 34th and V[Am]ine
[Dm]Sellin' little bottles of [E]Love Potion Number N[Am]ine
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>
<verse>
I told her that I was a flop with chicks
I'd been this way since 1956
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign
She said "What you need is Love Potion Number Nine"
</verse>


<h3>BRIDGE</h3>

<verse>
She b[Dm]ent down and turned around and gave me a wink
She s[B7]aid "I'm gonna make it up right here in the sink"
It s[Dm]melled like turpentine and looked like India ink
I h[E]eld my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink
</verse>


<h3>VERSE 3</h3>
<verse>
I didn't know if it was day or night
I started kissin' everything in sight
But when I kissed the cop down at 34th and Vine
He broke my little bottle of Love Potion Number Nine
</verse>
