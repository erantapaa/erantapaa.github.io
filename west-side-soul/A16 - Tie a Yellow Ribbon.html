<h3>[Verse]</h3>
<verse two-line>
C                             Em
I'm comin' home, I've done my time
         Gm               A7           Dm
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine
                   Fm   
If you received my letter
                C               Am
        tellin' you I'd soon be free
D7                              
Then you'll know just what to do
        Fm6               G7
        if you still want me
Fm6               G7
If you still want me

<h3>[Chorus]</h3>

Tie a yellow ribbon round the ole oak tree
          Gm                        A    A7   Dm
It's been three long years, do you still want me
                Fm                C   E   Am
If I don't see a ribbon round the ole oak tree
      C               C/G
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us
Am               A
Put the blame on me
   Dm7           Fm6         
If I don't see a yellow ribbon

Bus driver please look for me

Cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see
                    Fm    
I'm really still in prison
               C                  Am
        and my love she holds the key
D7
