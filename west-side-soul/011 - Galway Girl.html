<h3>VERSE 1</h3>
<verse>
[D]Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk 
On a [D]day -I-[A]ay-I-[G]ay 
[D]I met a little girl and we stopped to talk 
On a [D]fine soft [G]day -I-[D]ay 
And I [G]ask you, fr[D]iend, what's a fe[G]lla to d[D]o 
'Cause her h[Bm]air was black and her [G]eyes were [D]blue 
And I k[G]new right t[D]hen I'd be t[G]akin' a w[D]hirl 
'Round the S[Bm]althill Prom with a G[G]alway g[D]irl

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>
<verse>
We were halfway there when the rain came down 
On a day -I-ay-I-ay 
And she asked me up to her flat downtown 
Of a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay 
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do 
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue 
So I took her hand and I gave her a twirl 
And I lost my heart to a Galway girl 
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 3</h3>
<p><i>(Slower and sad)</i>
<verse>
When I woke up I was all alone 
With a broken heart and a ticket home 
And I ask you now, tell me what would you do 
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue 
'Cause I've traveled around. I've been all over this world 
Boys I ain't never seen nothin' like a Galway girl
</verse>
