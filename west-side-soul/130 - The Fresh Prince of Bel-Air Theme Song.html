<verse>
Now this is the story all about how, 
My life got flipped-turned upside down, 
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, 
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air. 
</verse>

<verse>
In West Philadelphia, born and raised 
On the playground is where I spent most of my days. 
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin all cool, 
And all shootin' some B-ball outside of the school. 
</verse>

<verse>
When a couple of guys who were up to no good, 
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood. 
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, 
And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air." 
</verse>

<verse>
I whistled for a cab, and when it came near, 
The license plate said "FRESH" and it had dice in the mirror. 
If anything I could say that this cab was rare, 
But I thought "Nah forget it, Yo home to Bel-Air." 
</verse>

<verse>
I pulled up to the house about seven or eight, 
and I yelled to the cabby "Yo homes, smell ya later." 
Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there, 
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air.
