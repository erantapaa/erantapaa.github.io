<verse two-line>
G                      G/F#     Em7     Cadd9
My life is brilliant.
G
My life is brilliant.
G/F#
My love is pure.
Em7
I saw an angel.
Cadd9
Of that I'm sure.
    G
She smiled at me on the subway.
        G/F#
She was with another man.
    Em7
But I won't lose no sleep on that,
       Cadd9      D/F#
'Cause I've got a plan.

<h3>CHORUS</h3>
 
<verse two-line>
Cadd9        D/F#     Em7          D/F#
You're beautiful.     You're beautiful.
Cadd9        D/F#      G
You're beautiful, it's true.
  Cadd9    D/F#      G   D/F# Em7
I saw your face in a crowded  place,
      Cadd9      D/F#    Em7
And I don't know what to do.
            Cadd9   D/F#    G     G/F#    Em7     Cadd9
'Cause I'll never   be with you. 
</verse>


<verse two-line>
           G
Yeah, she caught my eye, 
      G/F#
As we walked on by.
          Em7
She could see from my face that I was, 
Cadd9
  Flying high, 
    G                       G/F#
And I don't think that I'll see her again, 
    Em7                          Cadd9
But we shared a moment that will last till the end. 
</verse>

 Cadd9        D/F# Em7          D/F#
You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
Cadd9        D/F#      G
You're beautiful, it's true.
  Cadd9    D/F#      G   D/F# Em7
I saw your face in a crowded  place,
      Cadd9      D/F#    Em7
And I don't know what to do.
            Cadd9 D/F#    G
'Cause I'll never be with you.

You're beautiful, it's true.
      Cadd9      D/F#         G        D/F#   Em7
There must be an angel with a smile on her    face,
         Cadd9                    D/F#          G   D/F#   Em7 
When she thought up that I should be with you.

But it's time to face the truth, 
       Cadd9 D/F#     G
I will never be with you.
