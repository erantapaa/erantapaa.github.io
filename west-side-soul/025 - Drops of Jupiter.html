<h3>VERSE 1</h3>
<verse two-line>
C
Now that she's back in the atmosphere 
G                                   F
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey 
C
She acts like summer and walks like rain 
G                                        F
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey 
C
Since the return from her stay on the moon 
G                                                 F
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey 
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse two-line>
G                     A         D
Tell me did you sail across the Sun 
                             F                               C
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded 

And that heaven is overrated 
G                           A        D
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star 
                          Dm
One without a permanent scar 
                                   F 
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>
<verse two-line>
C
Now that she's back from that soul vacation 
G                                           F
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey 
C
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo 
G                                      F
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey 
C
Now that she's back in the atmosphere 
G                                          F
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane 

Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land 
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS 2</h3>
<verse two-line>
G                                  A    D
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet 
                                  F                           C
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day            

And head back to the Milky Way 
G                           A    D
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind 
                                 Dm
Was it everything you wanted to find 
                                   F 
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 
</verse>

<h3>BRIDGE</h3>
<verse two-line>
        G          C
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken 
     G                           F
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong 
        G          C                                 G
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation 
    Bb                                         F
The best soy latte that you ever had . . . and me 
</verse>

<verse>
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way

And are you lonely looking for yourself out there?

Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the milky way to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated

Tell me, did you fall from a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there
</verse>
