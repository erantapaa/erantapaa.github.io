It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
</verse>

<verse>
Dang, who knew?
All the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'll be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
</verse>

<verse>
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
</verse>

It's been a long day without you, my friend

</verse>

<verse>
(Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah
</verse>

<verse>
First you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turn to a friendship
A friendship turn to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reach
So remember me when I'm gone 
</verse>

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side

</verse>

<verse>
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take, will always lead you home, home
</verse>

<verse>
Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah
</verse>

<verse>
When I see you again
See you again
When I see you again
</verse>

<verse>
Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah
When I see you again
