<h3>VERSE 1</h3>

<verse>
[D]I got my first real six-string
[A]Bought it at the five-and-dime
[D]Played it 'til my fingers bled
[A]Was the summer of '69
</verse>

<verse>
Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>

<verse>
[Bm]Oh, when I [A]look back now
[D]That summer seemed to [G]last forever
[Bm]And if I [A]had the choice
[D]Yeah, I'd always [G]wanna be there
[Bm]Those were the [A]best days of my life
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>

<verse>
Ain't no use in complainin'
When you've got a job to do
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS 2</h3>

<verse>
Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Oh, yeah
Back in the summer of '69, oh
</verse>

<h3>BRIDGE</h3>

<verse>
[F]Man, we were [A#]killin' time,
we were [C]young and restless
We [A#]needed to unwind
[F]I guess [A#]nothin' can last for[C]ever
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 3</h3>

<verse>
And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
I think about you, wonder what went wrong
</verse>

<p> (Chorus 2)
