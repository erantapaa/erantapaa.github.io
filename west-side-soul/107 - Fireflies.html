<p>INTRO: G &mdash; C &mdash; F   (x2)

<verse>
[G]You would not believe your e[C]yes
[F]If ten million fireflies
Lit [G]up the world as I fell a[C]sleep   [F]
</verse>

<verse>
[G]'Cause they fill the [C]open air
[F]And leave teardrops everywhere
[G]You'd think me ru[C]de
But I would just st[F]and and stare
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse>
[F]I'd like to make [C]myself be[G]lieve
That planet [F]Earth [C]turns [Em]slowly  [F]
It's h[F]ard to say that
I'd [C]rather stay [F]awake wh[G]en I'm [Am]asleep
[F]'Cause everything is[C] never as it [D]seems
</verse>

<div class="keep-together">
<verse>
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
</verse>

<verse>
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging
By a thread (thread, thread)
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS)
<!--
<verse>
I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)
</verse>
-->

<verse>
[G &mdash; C &mdash; F]Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
</verse>

<verse>
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes
As they said farewell (said farewell)
</verse>

<verse>
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few
And I keep them in a jar (jar, jar)
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS x2)
