        G
One evening as the sun went down
         D                 G
And the jungle fires were burning,
          G
Down the track came a hobo hiking,
        D                     G
And he said, "Boys, I'm not turning
      C           G           C    G
I'm headed for a land that's far away
  G                  D
Besides the crystal fountains
     G
So come with me, we'll go and see
     C               G
The Big Rock Candy Mountains"

        G
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
            C                   G
There's a land that's fair and bright,
            C               G
Where the handouts grow on bushes
                          D
And you sleep out every night.
            G
Where the boxcars all are empty
         C                G
And the sun shines every day
         C             G
And the birds and the bees
          C          G
And the cigarette trees
     C          G
The lemonade springs
            C        G
Where the bluebird sings
        D               G
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
All the cops have wooden legs
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
The farmers' trees are full of fruit
And the barns are full of hay
Oh I'm bound to go
Where there ain't no snow
Where the rain don't fall
The winds don't blow
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.
</verse>

<verse>
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
You never change your socks
And the little streams of alcohol
Come trickling down the rocks
The brakemen have to tip their hats
And the railway bulls are blind
There's a lake of stew
And of whiskey too
You can paddle all around it
In a big canoe
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
</verse>

<verse>
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
The jails are made of tin.
And you can walk right out again,
As soon as you are in.
There ain't no short-handled shovels,
No axes, saws nor picks,
I'm bound to stay
Where you sleep all day,
Where they hung the jerk
That invented work
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.
</verse>

<verse two-line>
      C       G         C     G
I'll see you all this coming fall
        D               G
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
</verse>
