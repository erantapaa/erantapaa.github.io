<h3>VERSE 1</h3>

<verse>
Some[G]body once [D]told me the [Am]world is gonna [C]roll me
I [G]ain't the sharpest [D]tool in the [Am]shed   [C]
She was [G]looking kind of [D]dumb with her [Am]finger and her [C]thumb
In the [G]shape of an [D]"L" on her fore[Am]head  [C]
</verse>

<verse>
We[G]ll the years start coming and they[D] don't stop coming
[Am]Back to the rules and I h[C]it the ground running
Di[G]dn't make sense not to li[D]ve for fun
Your[Am] brain gets smart but yo[C]ur head gets dumb
So[G] much to do so[D] much to see
So [Am]what's wrong with taking the b[C]ack streets
You[G]'ll never know if you do[D]n't go
You[Am]'ll never shine if you d[C]on't glow
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>

<verse>
[G]Hey now you're an A[D]ll Star get [Am]your game on, g[C]o play
[G]Hey now you're a Ro[D]ck Star get [Am]the show on get[C] paid
[G]And all that g[D]litters is g[Am]old
[C]Only shooting st[G]ars br[F]eak the mol[C]d
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>

<verse>
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored
</verse>

<p>(Chorus x2)

<h3>VERSE 3</h3>

<verse>
Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow
</verse>

<p>(Chorus)<br/><br/>

<verse>
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
<//verse>
