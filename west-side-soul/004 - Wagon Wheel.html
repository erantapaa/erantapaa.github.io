<h3>VERSE 1</h3>

<verse>
[G]Headed down south to the [D]land of the pines
And I'm [Em]thumbin' my way into [C]North Caroline
[G]Starin' up the road
[D]Pray to God I see [C]headlights
</verse>

<verse>
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a hopin' for Raleigh
I can see my baby tonight
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>

<verse class="chorus">
So [G]rock me mama like a [D]wagon wheel
[Em]Rock me mama any[C]way you feel
[G]Hey[D] mama [C]rock me
[G]Rock me mama like the [D]wind and the rain
[Em]Rock me mama like a [C]south-bound train
[G]Hey[D] mama [C]rock me
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>

<verse>
Runnin' from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time string band
My baby plays the guitar
I pick a banjo now

Oh, the North country winters keep a gettin' me now
Lost my money playin' poker so I had to up and leave
But I ain't a turnin' back
To livin' that old life no more
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 3</h3>

<verse>
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly
Had a nice long toke
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee

And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name
And I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh
At least I will die free
</verse>
