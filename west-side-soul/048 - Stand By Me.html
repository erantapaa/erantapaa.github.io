<verse>
When the [A]night has come
[F#m]And the land is dark
And the [D]moon is the [E]only light we [A]see
No, I w[A]on't be afraid be afraid
No, I w[F#m]on't be afraid
Just as [D]long as you [E]stand, stand by [A]me.
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>

<verse>
So darlin', darlin stand by me
Oh s[F#m]tand by me
Oh s[D]tand, s[E]tand by me, stand by [A]me
</verse>

<verse>
If the ske we look upon
Should tumble and fall
And the mountains should
crumble to the see

I won't cry, I won't cry,
No, I won't shed a tear,
Just as long as you stand by me
</verse>

<p>(Chrorus)
