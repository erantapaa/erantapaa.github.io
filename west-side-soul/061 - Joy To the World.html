<verse>
[D]Jeremiah was a bullfrog
[D]Was a good friend of mine
[D]I never understood a sin[G]gle word he said
But I [D]helped him [A7]a-drink his [D]wine
And [G7]he always had some [A7]mighty fine [D]wine
Singin' ...
</verse>

<verse>
[D]Joy to the world
[A7]All the boys and girls n[D]ow
[D7]Joy to the fishes in the [G]deep blue sea
[D]Joy to [A7]you and [D]me
</verse>

<verse>
If I were the king of the world
Tell you what I'd do
I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the war
Make sweet love to you
Sing it now ...
</verse>

<verse>
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me
</verse>

<verse>
You know I love the ladies
Love to have my fun
I'm a high life flyer and a rainbow rider
A straight shootin' son-of-a-gun
I said a straight shootin' son-of-a-gun
</verse>

<verse>
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me
</verse>
