<verse two-line>
     G
Well you done done me and you bet I felt it,
   D
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted,
  Em
I fell right through the cracks,
C
And now I'm tryin to get back...
</verse>

<verse two-line>
            G
Before the cool done run out, I'll be givin it my bestest
    D
and Nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention
    Em
I reckon it's again my turn,
    C          
To win some or learn some....
</verse>


<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse two-line>
G              D
But I wont hesitate
            Em
No more, No more
            C              G   D   Em   C
It can not wait; I'm yours
</verse>


<verse two-line>
G                                    D
Well, open up your mind and see like me,
                                    Em
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
                                      C
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.
 G                                                 D                             Em
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
                                       C                            A7
And it's our god-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved.
</verse>

<pre>[Chorus]</pre>

<verse two-line>
G              D
So I won't hesitate
             Em
No more, no more
           C
It cannot wait, I'm sure
G                      D
There's no need to complicate
             Em
Our time is short
            C              G        
This is our fate, I'm yours
</verse>


<h3>BRIDGE</h3>

<verse two-line>
G                      Bm 
Doo do do doo doo do, doo do doo do doo do
Em                     D                C
Do you want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
                       A7
And I will nibble your ear
</verse>
<!-- G Bm Em D C A7 -->


<verse two-line>
                   G                       
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
      D                      
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
     Em
But my breath fogged up the glass
       C
And so I drew a new face and I laughed.
        G                          
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
   D                         
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons.
  Em
It's what we aim to do.
    C
Our name is our virtue.
</verse>

<pre>[Chorus]</pre>

<verse two-line>
G              D
But I won't hesitate
            Em
No more, No more
            C              G  
It can not wait; I'm yours
</verse>

<h3>OUTRO</h3>

<verse two-line>
G                                    D
Well, open up your mind and see like me,
                                    Em
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
                                      C
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours.
   G
So please don't, please don't, please don't...
        D
There's no need to complicate.
           Em
'Cause our time is short.
                             C
This oh, this oh, this is our fate.
           A7  G
I'm yours
</verse>
