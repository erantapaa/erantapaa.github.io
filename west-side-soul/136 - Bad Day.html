<p>Intro: D  G  A  G

<verse>
[D]  Where is the [G] moment when we need it the m[A]ost   [G]
[D]  You kick up the le[G]aves and the magic is l[A]ost
[Bm]  They tell me your bl[A]ue sky's faded to gre[G]y
The tell me your p[D]assion's gone aw[Em]ay
And I don't [G]need no carrying on[A  G  A] 
</verse>

<verse>
[D]  Stand in the li[G]ne just to hit a new l[A]ow
[D]  You're faking a sm[G]ile with the coffee you [A]go 
[Bm]  You tell me your li[A]fe's been way off li[G]ne 
You're falling to pi[D]eces everyti[Em]me 
And I don't ne[G]ed no carrying o[A]n 
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse>
Cause you had a bad d[D]ay 
You're taking one do[G]wn 
You sing a sad so[Em]ng just to turn it aro[A]und 
You say you don't kn[D]ow 
You tell me don't l[G]ie
You work at a smi[Em]le and you go for a ri[A]de 
You had a bad da[Bm]y
The camera don't li[A*]e
                    G                         D
You're coming back do[G]wn and you really don't mi[D]nd 
You had a bad d[Em]ay   [A]
You had a bad [D]day 
</verse>

<p>D G A G   x 2 

<h3>BRIDGE</h3>

<verse>
[Bm]Well you need a bl[A]ue sky holi[G]day
The point is they l[D]augh at what you s[Em]ay 
And I don't [G]need no carrying o[A]n 
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS)

<verse>
[F]Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the w[A#]hole thing it turns out wrong 
You m[F]ight not make it back and you know 
That you [A#]could be well oh that strong 
Well I'm not w[A Asus4 A]rong 

[D]So where is the pa[G]ssion when you need it the [A]most 
[G]Oh you and [D]I 
You kick up the le[G]aves and the magic is lo[A]st  
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS)

<verse>
It seem what you li[A#]ke 
And how does it [D]feel for one more [E]time 
You had a bad d[G]ay  [A]
had a bad [D]day  [G   Em   A  x4]
</verse>
