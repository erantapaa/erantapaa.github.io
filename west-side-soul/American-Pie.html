<h3>INTRO</h3>

<verse>
A [G]long, [D/F#]long, [Em]time ago,
[Am]I can still re[C]member how that
[Em]Music used to make me smile
And [G]I knew [D/F#]if         I [Em]had my chance
That [Am]I could make those [C]people dance, and
[Em]Maybe they'd be [C]happy for a [D]while

But, [Em]February [Am]made me shiver
With [Em]every paper [Am]I'd deliver
[C]Bad news [G/B]on the [Am]doorstep
I [C]couldn't take one [D]more step

I [G]can't re[D/F#]member [Em]if I cried
When I [Am]read about his [D]widowed bride
But, [G]something [D/F#]touched me [Em]deep inside
The [C]day the [D]music [G]died. So ...
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>

<verse class="break-after">
[G]Bye [C]bye, Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levee, but the [G]levee was [D]dry
And them [G]good ole [C]boys were drinking [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singing, [Em]this'll be the day that I [A7]die
[Em]This'll be the day that I [D7]die
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 1</h3>
<verse>
[G]Did you write the [Am]book of love
And do [C]you have faith in [Am]God above?
[Em]...If the Bible [D]tells you so
Do [G]you be[D/F#]lieve in [Em]Rock and Roll
Can [Am]music save your [C]mortal soul
And, [Em]can you teach me [C]how to dance [A7]real slow?  [D]
Well, I [Em]know that you're in [D]love with him
'Cause I [Em]saw you dancing [D]in the gym
You [C]both kicked [G/B]off your [Am]shoes
Man, [C]I dig those rhythm and [D7]blues
I was a [G]lonely [D/F#]teenage [Em]broncin' buck
With a [Em]pink carnation and a [C]pick-up truck
But, I [G]knew [D/F#]I was [Em]out of luck
The [C]day the [D]music [G]died.....[C].....[G].....[D].... I started singing...
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>

<verse>
Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died... we were singing...
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 3</h3>

<verse>
Helter Skelter in a summer swelter
The Byrds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul in the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh but, we never had the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died... we were singing...
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 4</h3>

<verse>
Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start, again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candle stick
Cause fire is the devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that Satan's spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died... we were singing...
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 5</h3>

<verse>
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But, the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But, not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died... and they were singing...
</verse>

<p>(Repeat CHORUS x 2)
