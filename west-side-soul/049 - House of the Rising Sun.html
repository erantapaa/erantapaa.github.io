[Am]There is a [C]house in [D]New Orleans  [F]
They [Am]call the [C]Rising [E]Sun
And it's [Am]been the [C]ruin of [D]many a poor [F]boy
And [Am]God, I [E]know I'm [Am]one.

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new bluejeans
My father was a gamblin' man
Down in New Orleans
</verse>

<verse>
Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on, a drunk
</verse>

<verse>
Oh mother tell your children
Not to do what I have done
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of the Rising Sun
</verse>

<verse>
Well, I got one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain
</verse>

<verse>
Well, there is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
And God I know I'm one
</verse>
