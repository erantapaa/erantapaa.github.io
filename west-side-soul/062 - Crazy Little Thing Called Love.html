<h3>#1</h3>
<verse>
[D]This thing, called love, I [G]just [C]can't handle [G]it,
[D]This thing, called love, I [G]must [C]get round to [G]it,
[D]I ain't ready, cra[Bb]zy little thi[C]ng called love[D].
</verse>

<h3>#2</h3>
<verse>
This thing (this thing) called love (called love)
It cries (like a baby) in a cradle all night
It swings (woo woo) It jives (woo woo)
It shakes all over like a jelly fish,
I kinda like it, crazy little thing called love
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>

<verse>
There goes my [G]baby, she [C]knows how to rock and [G]roll.
She drives me [Bb]crazy, she gives me [E]hot and cold [A]fever,
Then she [F]leaves me in a cool, cool sw[E]eat [A]
</verse>

<h3>#3</h3>
<verse>
I gotta be cool relax, get hip, get on my track's
Take a back seat, hitch-hike, and take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready, crazy little thing called love
</verse>

<p>INTERLUDE: <code>Bb D Bb... E A F... E A</code>

<p><i>(Repeat #3 acapella)</i>

<verse>
This thing, called love, I just cant handle it,
This thing, called love, I must get round to it,
I aint ready, crazy little thing called love.
Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
...
