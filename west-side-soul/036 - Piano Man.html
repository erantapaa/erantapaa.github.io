<h3>INTRO</h3>

</pre>

<verse two-line>
     C      G          F    C
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
    F       C              D7 G
The regular crowd shuffles in
           C       G       F       C
There's an old man sitting next to me
       F           G         C   G
Making love to his tonic and gin
</verse>

<verse two-line nochords>
          C            G         F   C
He says, "Son, can you play me a memory
    F          C           D7  G
I'm not really sure how it goes
         C            G   
But it's sad and it's sweet
      F          C
And I knew it complete
     F        G             C
When I wore a younger man's clothes."
</verse>

<!-- [Interlude] -->

<verse two-line>
Am              D7
la la la, di da da
Am           D7    G  F C G7
La la, di di da da dum
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>

<verse two-line>
C         G                F     C
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
F         C      D7   G
Sing us a song tonight
            C          G          F   C
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
    F                 G         C     G
And you've got us all feeling alright
</verse>

<verse two-line nochords>
    C           G        F         C
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
   F          C          D7  G
He gets me my drinks for free
         C            G  
And he's quick with a joke
          F             C
And he'll light up your smoke
            F               G           C   G
But there's some place that he'd rather be
</verse>

<verse two-line nochords>
          C         G             F       C
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."
       F          C            D7  G
As the smile ran away from his face
          C           G          F     C
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
   F           G           C
If I could get out of this place"
</verse>

<h3>INTERLUDE</h3>

<verse two-line >
Am              D7
La la la, di da da
Am           D7    G  F C G7
La la, di di da da dum
</verse>

<!-- [Verse 3] -->


<verse two-line nochords>
    C         G           F   C
Now Paul is a real estate novelist
    F         C          D7  G
Who never had time for a wife
         C            G   
And he's talking with Davy,
      F            C
Who's still in the Navy
    F             G      C   G
And probably will be for life
</verse>

<verse two-line nochords>
        C           G          F   C
And the waitress is practicing politics
       F           C           D7    G
As the businessman slowly gets stoned
             C         G               F     C
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
         F           G         C    G
But it's better than drinking alone
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS)

<verse two-line nochords>
       C           G           F    C
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
        F       C          D7    G
And the manager gives me a smile
          C               G 
'Cause he knows that it's me
             F         C
They've been coming to see
   F            G           C   G
To forget about life for a while
</verse>

<verse two-line nochords>
        C         G             F    C
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
        F          C             D7  G
And the microphone smells like a beer
         C          G           F           C
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
          F             G         C     G
And say, "Man, what are you doing here?"
</verse>

<!-- [Interlude] -->

<verse two-line>

La la la, di da da
Am           D7    G  F C G7
La la, di di da da dum
