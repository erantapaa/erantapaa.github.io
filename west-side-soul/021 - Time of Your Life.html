<h3>VERSE 1</h3>
<verse two-line>
G                       C                 D
Another turning point a fork stuck in the road,
G                                C                   D  
Time grabs you by the wrist, and directs you where to go
Em          D            C                 G
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
Em         D              C                 G
It's not a question but a lesson learned in time
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse two-line>
Em                    G           Em           G             
Its something unpredictable but in the end it's right
Em                 D            G 
I hope you had the time of your life.

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>
<verse two-line>
G                             C                    D
So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
G                         C                    D
Hang it on a shelf and in good health and good time
Em          D             C            G
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
Em            D            C             G    
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

So take the photographs, and still-frames in your mind
Hang them on a shelf in good health and good time
Tattoo's of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while
It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right
I hope you had the time of your life

It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
