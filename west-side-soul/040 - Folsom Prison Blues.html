<h3>VERSE 1</h3>
<verse two-line>
E
I hear the train a coming it's rolling round the bend
                                             E7   
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
     A                                        E   
I'm stuck at Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on
         B7                  A7             E
But that train keeps rolling on down to San Antone
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>
<verse>
When I was just a baby my mama told me son
Always be a good boy don't ever play with guns
Well I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and I cry
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 3</h3>
<verse>
I'll bet there's rich folks eatin' in some fancy dining car
Probably drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars
Well I know I had it comin' I know I can't be free
But those people keep a movin' that's what tortures me
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 4</h3>
<verse>
Well if they freed me from this prison if that railroad train was mine
Bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I long to stay
Then I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
</verse>
