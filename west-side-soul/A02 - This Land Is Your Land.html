<verse>
[G]This land is [C]your land, this land is [G]my land 
From Cali[D]fornia to the New York [G]Island
[G7]From the Redwood [C]Forest to the Gulf Stream [G]waters
[D7]This land was made for you and [G]me.
</verse>

<verse>
As I went walking that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
I saw below me that golden valley
This land was made for you and me.
</verse>

<verse>
I roamed and I rambled and I followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
While all around me a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and me.
</verse>

<verse>
When the sun came shining, and I was strolling
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
A voice was chanting, As the fog was lifting,
This land was made for you and me.
</verse>

<verse>
As I went walking I saw a sign there
And on the sign it said "No Trespassing."
But on the other side it didn't say nothing,
That side was made for you and me.
</verse>

<verse>
In the squares of the city, In the shadow of a steeple;
By the relief office, I'd seen my people.
As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking,
Is this land made for you and me?
</verse>

<verse>
Nobody living can ever stop me,
As I go walking that freedom highway;
Nobody living can make me turn back
This land was made for you and me.
</verse>

<p>(Repeat Chorus x2)
