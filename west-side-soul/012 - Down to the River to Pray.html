</ul>

<verse>
As I went [D]down in the [G]river to [D]pray
[A7]Studying about that [D]good old way
And [D]who shall wear the starry crown
Good [A7]Lord, [G]show me the [D]way!
</verse>

<verse>
[A7]O sisters, [D]let's go down,
[G]Let's go down, [D]come on down
[A7]O sisters, [D]let's go down
[G]Down in the river to [D]pray
</verse>
