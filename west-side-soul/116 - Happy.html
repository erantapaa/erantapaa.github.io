<p>[INTRO]: E7

<h3>[Verse]</h3>
<verse>
[E7]It might seem crazy what I am about to say[Em7  A  B  A  E7]
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way
</verse>

<h3>[Chorus]</h3>

<verse two-line>
E7          Cmaj7
Because I'm happy...
           Bm7                D/E            E7
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
E7          Cmaj7
Because I'm happy...
           Bm7              D/E              E7
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
E7          Cmaj7
Because I'm happy...
           Bm7              D/E             E7
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
E7          Cmaj7
Because I'm happy...
           Bm7              D/E                   E7
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
</verse>

<h3>[Verse]</h3>

<verse>
[E7]Here come bad news talking this and that[Em7  A  B  A  E7]
Well, give me all you got, and don't hold it back
Well, I should probably warn ya I'll be just fine
No offense to you, don't waste your time (Here's why)
</verse>
