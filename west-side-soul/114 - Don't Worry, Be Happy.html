Here's a little song I wrote

You might want to sing it note for note

Don't worry, be happy.
    G
In every life we have some trouble
Am
But when you worry you make it double
         C        G
Don't worry, be happy.
   G             G
Don't worry, be happy now.

Ain't got no place to lay your head

Somebody came and took your bed

The landlord say your rent is late

He may have to litigate

Look at me -- I'm happy.

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style

Don't worry, be happy.

'Cause when you worry your face will frown
  Am
And that will bring everybody down

Don't worry, be happy.
    G         G
Don't worry, be happy now.
