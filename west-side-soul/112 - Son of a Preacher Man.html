<h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
<verse class="smash-top">
B[E]illy Ray was a preacher's son
And when his d[A]addy would visit
    he'd c[E]ome along
When they'd gather 'round and started talking
[B7]That's when Billy would take me walking
A-through the back yard we'd go walking
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows to my surprise
</verse>


<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
<verse two-line class="smash-top">
     E
The only one who could ever reach me
A                   E
  Was the son of a preacher man
     E
The only boy who could ever teach me
A                    E
  Was the son of a preacher man
                B    A
Yes he was, he was,     mmm, yes he was

<h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
<verse class="smash-top">
B[E]eing good isn't always easy
No matter how [A]hard I'd try     [E]
When he started sweet-talkin' to me
[B7]He'd come and tell me everything is all right
He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right
Can I get away again tonight
</verse>

<p>(Chorus)

<h3>[Bridge]</h3>
<verse class="smash-top">
(Yes, he w[D]as)

How well I remember
[A]  The look was in his eyes
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly
[B7]   Takin' time to make time
Tellin' me that he's all mine
[E7]   Learnin' from each other's knowin'
Look at us here, how much we've grown
</verse>

<h3>[Chorus] (in A)</h3>
<verse two-line class="smash-top">
         A
And the only one who could ever reach me
D                    A
  Was the son of a preacher man
     A
The only boy who could ever teach me
D                    A
  Was the son of a preacher man
                E   D7
Yes he was, he was, ooh yes he was

<h3>[Coda]</h3>
<verse class="smash-top">
(The o[A]nly one who could ever reach me
               [D]    Was the son of a pr[A]eacher man)
He was the sweet-talking son
                      of a preacher man)

(The only boy who could ever teach me
                   Was the son of a preacher man)
           A kiss-stealin' son of a preacher man

(The only one who could ever move me
 Was the son of a preacher man)

(The only one who could ever groove me
 Was the son of a preacher man)
