Get up and dance to the music!
Get on up and dance to the fonky music!
</verse>

<verse>
Dance to the Music, dance to the music
Dance to the Music, dance to the music
</verse>

<verse>
All we need is a drummer
For people who only need a beat
I'm gonna add a little guitar
And make it easy to move your feet
</verse>

<verse>
I'm gonna add some bottom
So that the dancers just won't hide
</verse>

<verse>
You might like to hear my organ
I said ride Sally ride
If I could hear the horns blow
Cynthia on the throne, yeah!
</verse>

<verse>
Cynthia and Jerry got a message that's sayin'
All the squares, go home!
</verse>

<verse>
Dance to the Music, dance to the music
Dance to the Music, dance to the music
