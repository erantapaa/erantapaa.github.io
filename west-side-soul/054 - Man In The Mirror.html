<verse two-line full-lines>
G         D/F#        Em 
I'm gonna make a change, 
D              C
For once in my life
           G         D/F#    Em     
It's gonna feel real good
             Em
Gonna make a difference
D             C
Gonna make it right
</verse>

<br/>
<verse two-line full-lines>
     G        D/F#         
As I, turn up the collar on
Em           D
My favorite winter coat,
C
This wind is blowin' my mind
          G           D/F#  
I see the kids in the street,
         Em            D
With not enough to eat
          C
Who am I, to be blind,

Pretending not to see their needs
</verse>

<br/>
<verse two-line>
Am7                  C/B
A summer's disregard,

A broken bottle top
C                 C/B
And a one man's soul
     Am7                      C/B
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
            C                 D
'Cause they got nowhere to go
                              G
That's why I want you to know
</verse>

<h3 class="column-break">CHORUS</h3>
<verse two-line full-lines>
G   G/B               C          D
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
G   G/B           C          D
I'm asking him to change his ways
G      G/B                C        A/C#
And no message could have been any clearer
        Dm
If you wanna make the world a better place
     
Take a look at yourself,
                     G   D/F#
And then make a change
</verse>

<br/>
<verse two-line full-lines>
G           D/F#      Em        D
I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
C
It's time that I realize
          G            D/F#
There are some with no home,
      Em             D
Not a nickel to loan
            C
Could it be really me

Pretending that they're not alone?
</verse>

<br/>
<verse>
Am7                     C/B
A willow deeply scarred

Somebody's broken heart
C                C/B
And a washed-out dream
     Am7                       C/B
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya' see
            C                  D
'Cause they got no place to be
                               G
That's why I'm starting with me
</verse>
<p>(CHORUS)
