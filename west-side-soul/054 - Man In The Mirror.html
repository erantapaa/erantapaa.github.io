[Intro]
| G D/F# | Em D | C(add9) | C(add9) [ C/D ] |


[Verse]
G          D/F#
 I'm gonna make a change
Em    D           C(add9)   [ C/D ]
  For once in my life
           G         D/F#
It's gonna feel real good
             Em                D       C(add9)
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right


[Verse]
    G            D/F#
As I turn up the collar on
Em           D           
 My favorite winter coat
C(add9)                          [ C/D ]
 This wind is blowing my mind
          G           D/F#
I see the kids in the street
         Em
With not enough to eat
D         C(add9)
 Who am I to be blind? Pretending not to see their needs


[Bridge]
Am7                   G/B
 A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
C(add9)
 And one man's soul (and a one man's soul)
     Am7                      G/B
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
            C(add9)        C/D                             [ G ]
'Cause they got nowhere to go, that's why I want you to know


[Chorus]
G    G/B               C          D7sus4
 I'm starting with the man in the mirror
G    G/B           C          D7sus4
 I'm asking him to change his ways
G       G7/B               C        C#dim
 And no message could have been any clearer
       Csus4/D
If you want to make the world a better place
       Csus4/D                              [ G ]
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change


[Interlude]
| G D/F# | Em D | C(add9) | C(add9) [ C/D ] |
           (Na, na, na, ...)


[Verse]
G            D/F#     Em         D
 I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
C(add9)         
 It's time that I realize
               G            D/F#        Em             [ D ]
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
D            C(add9)               
 Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?


[Bridge]
Am7                      G/B
 A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
C(add9)           G/B
 And a washed-out dream
     Am7                       G/B
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see
            C(add9)         C/D                               [ G ]
'Cause they got no place to be, that's why I'm starting with me


[Chorus]
G    G/B               C          D7sus4
 I'm starting with the man in the mirror
G    G/B           C          D7sus4
 I'm asking him to change his ways
G       G/B                C        C#dim
 And no message could have been any clearer
       Csus4/D
If you want to make the world a better place
       Csus4/D                              [ G ]
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change


[Chorus]
G    G/B               C          D7sus4
 I'm starting with the man in the mirror
G    G/B           C          D7sus4
 I'm asking him to change his ways
G       G/B                C        C#dim
 And no message could have been any clearer
       Csus4/D
If you want to make the world a better place
       Csus4/D                    Csus4/D Csus4/D [ break ]
Take a look at yourself, and then make    that


[Chorus]
Ab          Ab/C              Db         Db/Eb
Change! I'm starting with the man in the mirror
Ab   Ab/C          Db         Db/Eb
 I'm asking him to change his ways
Ab  Ab/C               Db       Ddim
 No message could have been any clearer
       Dbsus4/Eb
If you want to make the world a better place
       Dbsus4/Eb   
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
          Dbsus4/Eb
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
          Dbsus4/Eb            Dbsus4/Eb Dbsus4/Eb   [ Ab ]
You can't close your, then you close     your,       mind!


[Chorus]
Ab   Ab/C              Db         Db/Eb
 I'm starting with the man in the mirror
Ab   Ab/C          Db         Db/Eb
 I'm asking him to change his ways
Ab  Ab/C               Db       Ddim
 No message could have been any clearer
       Dbsus4/Eb
If you want to make the world a better place
       Dbsus4/Eb   
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
