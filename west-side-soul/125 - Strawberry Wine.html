<h3>[Verse]</h3>
<verse two-line>
C                          F
He was working through college
C                 G
On my grandpa's farm
C                        F
I was thirsting for knowledge
C              G
And he had a car
C                    
I was caught somewhere
                    F
        between a woman and a child
C                 
One restless summer
                     F
        we found love growning wild
G                     
On the banks of a river
              F
        on a well beaten path
G                               
Ain't it funny how those memories
             F
        they last like...
</verse>

<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
<verse two-line>
         C              G
Strawberry wine and seventeen
             Am
The hot July moon
             F
Saw everything
                 C          G
My first taste of love was bittersweet
           C               F
Green on the Vine
            C
Like Strawberry wine

<h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
<verse two-line>
C               F
I still remember
C               G
When thirty was old
C                       F
My biggest fear was September
C               G
When he had to go
C                     
A few cards and letters
                F
        and one long distance call
C                  
We drifted away like
                   F
        the leaves in the fall
G                    
But year after year I
                  F
        came back to this place
G                       F
Just to remember the taste of...

<h3>[Bridge]</h3>
<verse two-line>
      F
The fields have grown over now
F
Years since the've seen the plow
F
There'e nothing time hasn't touched
Am                              C                   G
Was it really him or the loss of my innocence
                     G
I've been missing so much!
        C   G   Am   F
Yaaaaaah.
