 [Intro]
 
 G  D/F#  Cadd9

 [Verse 1]

     G               D/F#        Cadd9
 You only know what I want you to, 
         G                   D/F#      Cadd9
 I know everything you don't want me to.
         G                     D/F#       Cadd9
 Oh your mouth is poison, your mouth is wine...
        G                         D/F#      Cadd9
 Oh you think your dreams are the same as mine...


 [Chorus]

    G                       D/F# 
 oh I don't love you, but I always will, 
  Cadd9                            D/F#
 oh I don't love you, but I always will.
 G                       D/F#
 I don't love you, but I always will, 
   Cadd9
 I always, will..


 [Verse 2]

   G                         D/F#       Cadd9
 I wish you'd hold me when I turn my back,
         G                D/F#          Cadd9
 ooh the less I give, the more I get back...
         G                    D/F#         Cadd9
 Oh your hands can heal, your hands can bruise,
         G                  D/F#           Cadd9
 I don't have a choice, but I still choose you...


 [Chorus]

    G                       D/F#
 Oh I don't love you, but I always will,
   Cadd9                          D/F#
 oh I don't love you, but I always will...
 G                       D/F#
 I don't love you, but I always will, 
   Cadd9                          D/F# 
 oh I don't love you, but I always will.
 G                       D/F#        Cadd9                           D/F#
 I don't love you, but I always will, I don't love you, but I always will.
 G                       D/F#           Cadd9
 I don't love you, but I always will, I always, will.
   G           D/F#
 I always, will...
   Cadd9        
 I always, will...
   G           D/F#
 I always, will...
   Cadd9
 I always, will...
