[Em7]Yeah, once I was a boogie singer
Playin' in a rock and roll band
And never had no problems yeah
Burnin' down one night stands
And everything around me, yeah
Got to stop to feelin' so low
And I decided quickly, yes I did
To disco down and check out the show
Yeah they was...
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse>
[D]Dan[Em]cin' and[D] sin[E]gin'
And mo[D]vin' [E]to the [D]groovi[E]n'
And j[D]ust wh[Em]en it h[D]it me[Em]
S[D]omeb[Em]ody turned around and shouted
[Gm7]Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music whit[Bbm]e boy
[Em]Lay down the boog[Bm]ie
And play tha[A7]t funky music till you die
Till you die, oh till you [B7]die

I tried to understand this
I thought that they were out of their minds
How could I be so foolish (How could I)
To not see I was the one behind
So still I kept on fighting
Well, loosing every step of the way
I said, I must go back there (I got to go back)
And check to see if things still the same
Yeah they was...
</verse>
<p>(CHORUS)
<!--
dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'
And just when it hit me somebody turned around and shouted
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die, ya
Till you die
-->

<verse>
Now first it wasn't easy
Changin' Rock and Roll and minds
And things were getting shaky
I thought I'd have to leave it behind
But now its so much better (it's so much better)
I'm funking out in every way
But I'll never lose that feelin' (no I won't)
Of how I learned my lesson that day
When they were...
</verse>
<p>(CHORUS)
<!--
 dancin' and singin' and movin' to the groovin'

Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music till you die
Till you die
Oh' till you die

They shouted play that funky music
(Play that funky music)
Play that funky music
(You Gotta keep on playin' funky music)
Play that funky music
(Play that funky music)
Play that funky music
(Come and take you higher, ya)
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right, ya
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music white boy
Play that funky music right
