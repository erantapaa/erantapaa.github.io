<h3>VERSE 1</h3>
<verse two-line class="smash-top">
D                A      G    D 
Such a feelin's coming over me,
         F#m            Em   A7       D
There is wonder in most everything I see
        G           A  
Not a cloud in the sky,
            F#m        B7
    got the sun in my eyes
      Em7                   Em7-5     A7
And I won't be surprised if it's a    dream.
</verse>
<verse two-line>
   D          A         G      D 
Everything I want the world to be,
       F#m          Em    A7     D
Is now coming true especially for me
           G       A    
And the reason is clear,
         F#m              B7
    it's because you are near
           Em7          
You're the nearest thing 
              Em7-5      A   A7
    to heaven that I've seen
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse class="smash-top">
I'm on the...
[D]Top of the world looking [G]down on creation,
And the on[D]ly expla[Em]nation I can f[D]ind   [D7]
Is the lo[G]ve that I've fo[A7]und,
    ever si[D]nce you've been aro[G]und,
Your love's p[D]ut me at the [Em]top [A7]of the w[D]orld.  [A7   D]

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>
<verse two-line class="smash-top">
D                A          G         D
Something in the wind has learned my name
        F#m               Em      A7       D
And its telling me that things are not the same
        G               A 
In the leaves on the trees
            F#m          B7
    and the touch of the breeze
        Em7                 Em7-5       A7
There a pleasin' sense of happiness for me.
</verse>
<verse two-line>
D             A          G    D
There is only one wish on my mind
         F#m               Em        A7      D
When this day is through I hope that I will find
        G          A 
That tomorrow will be
             F#m              B7
    just the same for you and me
     Em7      
All I need will
       Em7-5          A     A7
    be mine if you are here
