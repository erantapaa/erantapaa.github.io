<h3>VERSE 1</h3>
<verse>
Old Dan Tucker was a [F]fine old man
[G]Washed his face with a [C]fryin' pan
[C]Combed his hair with a [F]wagon wheel
And [G]died with a toothache [C]in his heel
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>
<verse>
Old Dan Tucker come to town
Riding a billy goat, leading a hound
The hound dog barked and billy goat jumped
And landed old Tucker on a stump
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 3</h3>
<verse>
Old Dan Tucker got drunk an fell
In the fire and kicked up holy hell
A red-hot coal got in his shoe
An oh my Lord the ashes flew
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 4</h3>

Now Old Dan Tucker come to town
Swinging them ladies all round
First to the right an then to the left
Then to the gal that he loved best
