<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse>
It's S[C]upercalifragilisticexpialido[G]cious!
Even though the sound of it
Is so[G7]mething quite a[C]trocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound pre[F]cocious
[F]Supercalifr[C]agilistice[G]xpialido[C]cious!

<verse>
So when the cat has got your tongue
There's no need for dismay
Just summon up this word and then
You've got a lot to say
But better use it carefully
Or it can change your life
</verse>
<p>(Spoken) For example? Yes?
<verse>
One night I said it to me girl
And now me girls my wife
Oh! And a lovely thing she is too.
She's ...
