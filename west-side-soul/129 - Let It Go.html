<h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
<verse two-line class="smash-top">
    Em                      C
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
      D               Asus4   Am
Not a footprint to be seen
  Em            C
A kingdom of isolation
       D                  Asus4    A
And it looks like I'm the queen
Em            C                
  The wind is howling like this
D                 Asus4  Am
swirling storm inside
Em                 D                    A
  Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
</verse>

<h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
<verse two-line class="smash-top">
D                                 C
Don't let them in, don't let them see
                                    D
Be the good girl you always have to be
                                    C
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
               Cadd2
Well, now they know
</verse>

<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
<verse two-line class="smash-top">
       G          Dsus4/F#
Let it go, let it go
      Em7             Cadd9
Can't hold it back anymore
          G          Dsus4/F#
Let it go, let it go 
      Em7              Cadd9
Turn away and slam the door
G       Dsus4/F#          Em7      Cadd9
I don't care what they're going to say
        Bm7         Bb
Let the storm rage on
    C
The cold never bothered me anyway
</verse>

<h3 class="column-break">[Verse 2]</h3>
<verse two-line class="smash-top">
   Em                    C  
It's funny how some distance
          D               Am
make everything seem small
        Em              D           
And the fears that once controlled me
      Asus4        A
can't get to me at all
</verse>

<h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
<verse two-line class="smash-top">
D                            Cadd9
It's time to see what I can do
                             D  
To test the limits and break through
                                 Cadd9
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
    Cadd2
I'm free
</verse>

<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
<verse two-line nochords class="smash-top">
       G          Dsus4/F#
Let it go, let it go
      Em7             Cadd9
I am one with the wind and sky
          G          Dsus4/F#
Let it go, let it go
      Em7              Cadd9
You'll never see me cry
G       Dsus4/F#          Em7      Cadd9
Here I stand and here I'll stay
        Bm7         Bb      C
Let the storm rage on
</verse>

<h3>[Bridge]</h3>
<verse two-line class="smash-top">
C
My power flurries through the air into the ground
C
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
D
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Em        C              D               Am     C
I'm never going back, the past is in the past
</verse>

<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
<verse class="smash-top">
Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
[G]Here I [Dsus4/F#]stand in the [Em7]light of [Cadd9    Cm]day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway 
</verse>
