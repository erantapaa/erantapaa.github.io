<verse>
I can see what's h[C]appening (What?)
An[F]d they don't have a [C]clue (Who?)
They'[F]ll fall in love and [G]here's the [Am]bottom line
Our [F]trio's down to [G]two.  (Oh.)
</verse>

<verse>
The sweet caress of twilight
There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse>
C[C]an you [G]feel the [Am]love to[F]night?
[C]The peace the [F]evening b[G]rings
The [F]world, for [C]once, in [G]perfect [Am]harmony
With [F]all its li[G]ving things
</verse>

<verse>
So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? Impossible!
She'd turn away from me
</verse>

<verse>
He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is
The king I see inside?
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS)
<!--
<verse>
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things
</verse>
-->

<verse>
[G]Can yo[D]u feel t[Em]he love [C]tonight?
You need[C]n't loo[D]k too far
[C]Stealing [G]through [Em]the nigh[C]t's uncertainties
[C]Love is [D]where they are
</verse>

<verse>
An[C]d if[G] he falls [Am]in love [F]tonight
[C]It can [F]be [G]assumed
His c[F]arefre[C]e days [G]with [Am]us are history
In s[F]hort, o[G]ur pal [C]is doomed
