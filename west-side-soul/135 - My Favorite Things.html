[Em]Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
[Cmaj7]Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
[Am7]Brown paper [D9]packages [G]tied up with [C]strings
[G]These are a [C]few of my [F#m7]favorite [B7]things    [Em]
</verse>

<verse>
Cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things
</verse>

<verse>
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver-white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things
</verse>

<verse>
[Em]When the dog bites
[Am7]When the bee [B7]stings
[Em]When I'm feeling [C]sad
I [C]simply [Am7]remember my [A7]favorite things
And [G]then I don't [C]feel [D9]so  [G]bad
</verse>
