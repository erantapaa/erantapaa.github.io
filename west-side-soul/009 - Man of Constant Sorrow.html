<p><i>Capo III</i>
<verse>
[D]In constant sor[A]row all through his [D]days
</verse>

<verse>
[D]I am a man of constant [G]sorrow
I've seen [A]trouble all my [D]day.
I bid farewell to old [G]Kentucky
The place where [A]I was born and [D]raised.
The place where [A]he was born and [D]raised.
</verse>

<verse>
For six long years I've been in trouble
No pleasures here on earth I found
For in this world I'm bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me now.
He has no friends to help him now.
</verse>

<verse>
It's fare thee well my old lover
I never expect to see you again
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad
Perhaps I'll die upon this train.
Perhaps he'll die upon this train.
</verse>

<verse>
You can bury me in some deep valley
For many years where I may lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave.
While he is sleeping in his grave.
</verse>

<verse>
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
My face you'll never see no more.
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shore.
He'll meet you on God's golden shore.
</verse>
