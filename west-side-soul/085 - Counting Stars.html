<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse>
[Am]Lately, I've been, [C]I've been losing sleep
[G]Dreaming about the things that [F]we could be
But [Am]baby, I've been, [C]I've been praying hard
[G]Said no more counting dollars
[F]We'll be counting stars
Yeah [F]we'll be counting stars
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 1</h3>
<verse>
I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find
</verse>

<verse>
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told
</verse>

<verse>
I-I-I-I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I-I-I-I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
</verse>

<verse>
[F]I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me
    makes me feel alive
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS x2)
<!--
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>
<verse>
I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
</verse>
</div>

<verse>
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told
</verse>

<verse>
I-I-I-I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
</verse>
<verse>
[F]I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that drowns me
    makes me wanna fly
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS x2)
<!--
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
-->

<h3>REFRAIN</h3>
<verse>
[Am]Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river 
The lessons I've learned (x4)
</verse>

<verse>
[F]Everything that kills me,
    makes feel alive...
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS x2)
<p>(REFRAIN x4)
