<h3>VERSE 1</h3>
<verse two-line>
C                  G      C     G 
No New Year`s day, to celebrate, 
             C                    
No chocolate covered candy hearts
         DmM7
To give away. 
            Dm      DmM7       Dm   DmM7                   
No first of spring, no song to sing, 
        Dm                  G        C
In fact here`s just another ordinary day. 
</verse>

<verse two-line nochords>
C                 G       C    G                   
No April rain, no flowers bloom, 
           C                            Dm  DmM7
No wedding Saturday within the month of June. 
            Dm  DmM7         Dm  DmM7                  
But what it is, is something true, 
           Dm                     G   
Made up of these three words that I must
       C
Say to you. 
</verse>
  
<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse two-line>
       Dm        G     C              
I just called to say I love you, 
       F         G              Am 
I just called to say how much I care. 
       Dm        G     C                       
I just called to say I love you, 
      F                G            C 
and I mean it from the bottom of my heart. 
</verse>
  
<h3 class="column-break">VERSE 2</h3>
<verse two-line nochords>
            C     G       C  G
No summer`s high, no warm July, 
           C                               Dm  DmM7 
No harvest moon to light one tender August night. 
          Dm      DmM7       Dm    DmM7 
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves, 
         Dm                G               C
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies. 
</verse>

<verse two-line nochords>
         C    G        C  G                 
No Libra Sun, no Halloween, 
          C                                   Dm   DmM7 
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring. 
            Dm  DmM7           Dm  DmM7 
But what it is, though old, so new. 
             Dm                  G                C 
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do.
