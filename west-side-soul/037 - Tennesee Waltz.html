<h3>VERSE 1</h3>
<verse two-line>
      D                             D7        G
I was dancin' with my darlin to the Tennessee Waltz
        D            Bm          E    A
When an old friend I happened to see.
       D                           D7              G
I introduced him to my darlin' and while they were dancin'
   D               G    D     A    D
my friend stole my sweetheart from me.
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS 1</h3>
<verse two-line>
  D            D7            G         D
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
                       Bm          E    A
'cause I know just how much I have lost
      D                          D7              G
Yes I lost my little darlin' the night they were playin'
     D         G  D  A   D 
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>
<verse two-line nochords>
      D                           D7        G
Now I wonder how a dance like the Tennessee Waltze
           D         Bm          E    A
Could have broken my heart so complete
       D                              D7             G
Well I couldn't blame my darlin', and who could help fallin'
   D            G  D    A  D
In love with my darlin' so sweet
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS 2</h3>
<verse two-line nochords>
        D           D7           G         D
Well it must be the fault of the Tennessee Waltz  
                        Bm            E     A
Wish I'd known just how much it would cost              
      D                               D7           G
But I didn't see it commin', it's all over but the cryin'  
         D          G  D  A   D
Blame it all on the Tennessee Waltz
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 3</h3>
<verse two-line nochords>
 D                                D7        G
She goes dancin' with the darkness to the Tennessee Waltz
      D             Bm       E      A
and I feel like I'm falling apart
         D                            D7          G 
and it's stronger than drink and it's deeper than sorrow
     D            G    D  A  D  
this darkness she left in my heart
</verse>
