<verse>
[C]I'd like to build the world a home
And [D7]furnish it with love
Grow [G7]apple trees and honey bees
And [F]snow-white turtle [C]doves
</verse>

<verse>
I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony
I'd like to hold it in my arms
And keep it company
</verse>

<verse>
I'd like to see the world for once
All standing hand in hand
And hear them echo through the hills
For peace through out the land
</verse>

<verse>
That's the song I hear
Let the world sing to[D7]day
A song of peace that echo's on
And [F]never goes [C]away
</verse>

<P> (Repeat)
