Hey, hey, we're the [C]Monkees  [C7]
And [F]people say we [G]monkey a[C]round  [C7]
But [F]we're too [G]busy [C]singing  [C7]
To [F]put any[G]body [Am]down

We go wherever we want to
Do what we like to do
We don't have time to get restless
There's always something new

Come and watch us sing and play

And we've got something to say, oh

Guess who'll be standing [G]there?

Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
You never know where we'll be found
So you'd better get ready
We may be comin' to your town

Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
Hey, hey, we're the Monkees
