Down by the [C]bay where the watermelons [G7]grow 
Back to my [G7]home I dare not [C]go 
For if I [F]do my mother will [C]say,
"Did you ever see a goose kissing a moose?" 
[G7]Down by the [C]bay

<pre style="font-family: Helvetica; line-height: 1.5em">
Did you ever see ...
... a bear combing his hair?
... fly wearing a tie?
... llama eating pajamas?
... whale with a polka-dot tail?
... snake with a birthday cake?
... fly making a pie?
... monkey dancin' kinda funky?
... bananas wearing green pajamas?
... shark singing like a lark?
... loon in a hot air balloon?
</pre>

<p>Did you ever have a time when you couldn't make a rhyme?
