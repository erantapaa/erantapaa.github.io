<verse two-line>
E      B             C#m           A          
Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world
E           B                     G#m   A
She took the midnight train going anywhere
</verse>

<verse>
Just a city boy, born and raise in South Detroit
He took the midnight train going anywhere
</verse>

<verse>
A singer in a smokey room, the smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night, it goes on and on, and on, and on
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse two-line>
B/A  A   B/A  C#m/A   E               B/E  E
Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard
 B/A    A    B/A  C#m/A         B/E   E
Their shadows searching in the night
B/A  A    B/A  C#m/A   E               B/E  E
Streetlight, people, living just to find emotion
B/A  A   B/A  C#m/A      B  E B E A
Hiding, somewhere in the night
</verse>

<verse>
Working hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill
Paying anything to roll the dice, just one more time
Some will win, some will lose, some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends; it goes on and on and on and on
</verse>

<verse>
Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight people, livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night
</verse>

<p><i>(Instrumental interlude)</i>

<verse two-lines>
E             B       C#m            A      #
Don't stop believing hold on to the feeling
E          B           G#m   A
Streetlight people
