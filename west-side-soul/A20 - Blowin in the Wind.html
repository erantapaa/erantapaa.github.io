[D]How many [G]roads must a [D]man walk down
Before you [G]call him a [D]man
[D]How many [G]seas must a [D]white dove sail
Before she [G]sleeps in the [A]sand
[D]How many [G]times must the [D]cannon balls fly
Before they're [G]forever [D]banned
The [G]answer, my [A]friend, is [D]blowin' in the [Bm]wind
The [G]answer is [A]blowin' in the [D]wind

Yes, 'n' [D]how many [G]years can a [D]mountain exist
Before it's [G]washed to the [D]sea
Yes, 'n' [D]how many [G]years can some [D]people exist
Before they're [G]allowed to be [A]free
Yes, 'n' [D]how many [G]times can a [D]man turn his head
And pretend that [G]he just doesn't [D]see
The [G]answer, my [A]friend, is [D]blowin' in the [Bm]wind
The [G]answer is [A]blowin' in the [D]wind

Yes, 'n' [D]how many [G]times must a [D]man look up
Before he can [G]see the [D]sky
Yes, 'n' [D]how many [G]ears must [D]one man have
Before he can [G]hear people [A]cry
Yes, 'n' [D]how many [G]deaths will it [D]take till he knows
That [G]too many people have [D]died
The [G]answer, my [A]friend, is [D]blowin' in the [Bm]wind
The [G]answer is [A]blowin' in the [D]wind
