Can you feel it?
Now it's coming back
We can steal it.
If we bridge this gap,
I can see you
Through the curtains of the waterfall.
</verse>

<verse>
When I lost it,
Yeah you held my hand,
But I tossed it,
Didn't understand,
You were waiting,
As I dove into the waterfall.
</verse>

<h3>Chorus:</h3>
<verse>
So say Geronimo!  Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!  Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!  Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
</verse>

<verse>
Can you feel my love?
Bombs away, Bombs away, Bombs away.
Can you feel my love?
Bombs away, Bombs away, Bombs away,
Say Geronimo!
</verse>

<verse>
Well we rushed it,
Moving way too fast.
That we crushed it,
But it's in the past.
We can make this leap,
Through the curtains of the waterfall.
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS)
<!--
<verse>
So Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
</verse>

<verse>
Can you feel my love?
Bombs away,
Bombs away,
Bombs away.
Can you feel my love?
Bombs away,
Bombs away,
Bombs away.
</verse>

<h3>Bridge:</h3>
<verse>
Well I'm just a boy,
With a broken toy,
All lost and coy,
At the curtains of the waterfall.
</verse>

<verse>
So it's here I stand,
As a broken man,
But I've found my friend,
At the curtains of the waterfall.
</verse>

<verse>
Now I'm falling down,
Through the crashing sound.
And you've come around,
At the curtains of the waterfall.
</verse>

<verse>
And you rushed to me,
And it sets us free.
So I fall to my knees,
At the curtains of the waterfall.
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS)
<!--
<verse>
So Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
</verse>

<verse>
Can you feel (Say Geronimo! [x4]) my love?
Bombs away! [x3] (Say Geronimo! [x4])
Can you feel (make this leap [x4]) my love? Make this leap.
Can you feel my love?
