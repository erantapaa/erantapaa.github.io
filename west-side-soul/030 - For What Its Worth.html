What it is ain't exactly clear.

There's a man with a gun over there
          E                    A
A-tellin' me I've got to beware.

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>

There's battle lines bein' drawn.

Nobody's right if everybody's wrong.

Young people speakin' their minds
          E                  A

What a field day for the heat.
E                        A       G
A thousand people in the street
E                              A  G
Singin' songs and a-carryin' signs
        E                    A    G    
Mostly sayin' hooray for our side.

Into your life it will creep.

It starts when you're always afraid.
            E                      A
Step out of line, the men come and take you away.
