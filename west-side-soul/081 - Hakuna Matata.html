Why, when he was a young warthog
When I was a young wart-hoooog!
Very nice!
Thanks!
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the Savannah after every meal
I'm a sensitive soul, though I seem thick-skinned
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind
</verse>

<verse>

(Oh, what's in a name?)

Pumbaa! Not in front of the kids!
Oh... sorry
</verse>
