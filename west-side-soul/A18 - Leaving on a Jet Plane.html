<p><i>Capo II</i>
<p>INTRO: G   C   Am   C   G   D7
<verse>
[D7]All my [G]bags are packed
I'm [C]ready to go
I'm [G]standin' here out[C]side your door
I [G]hate to wake you [C]up to say good[D7]bye
But the [G]dawn is breakin'
It's [C]early morn
The [G]taxi's waitin'
He's [C]blowin' his horn
Al[G]ready I'm so [C]lonesome
I could [D7]die
</verse>

<verse>
So [G]kiss me and [C]smile for me
[G]Tell me that you'll [C]wait for me
[G]Hold me like you'll [Am]never let me [D7]go
'Cause I'm [G]leavin' [C]on a jet plane
[G]Don't know when [C]I'll be back a[D7]gain
Oh [G]babe, I [C]hate to [D7]go
</verse>

<verse>
There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Ev'ry place I go, I'll think of you
Ev'ry song I sing, I'll sing for you
When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring
</verse>

<verse>
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
</verse>

<verse>
Now the time has come to leave you
One more time
Let me kiss you
Then close your eyes
I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times, I won't have to say
</verse>

<verse>
Oh, kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
</verse>

<verse>
But, I'm leavin' on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
</verse>
