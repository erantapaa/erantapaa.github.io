<h3>[Intro]</h3>
<pre>Am / Am G Am / Am G Am / Am Em F 
Am / Am G Am / Am G Am / Am Em F 
</pre>

<h3>[Verse]</h3>
<verse two-line>
Am              F
   Risin' up, back on the street,
G                      Am
  Did my time, took my chances.
Am                             F
  Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet,
        G                     Am
Just a man and his will to survive.
</verse>

<verse two-line>
Am                  F
  So many times, it happens too fast,
G                             Am
  You change your passion for glory
Am                            F
  Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past,
          G                        Am
You must fight just to keep them alive:
</verse>

<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
<verse two-line>
G2    Am    Dm              
It's  the   eye of the tiger,
          C             G
It's the thrill of the fight
      Dm                          Am   G
Rising up to the challenge of our ri-val.
         Dm               
And the last known survivor
              C           G
Stalks his prey in the night,
          Dm          Em9          F            Am
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger.
</verse>

<h3>[Interlude]</h3>

<h3>[Verse]</h3>
<verse two-line>
Am              F
Face to face, out in the heat,
G                      Am
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry.
Am                             F
They stack the odds, still we take to the street,
        G                     Am
For we kill with the skill to survive.
</verse>

      Dm                          Am   G
Rising up to the challenge of our ri-val.
         Dm                               C           G

<verse two-line>
Am              F
Risin' up, straight to the top,
G                      Am
Had the guts, got the glory.
Am                             F
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop,
        G                     Am
Just a man and his will to survive.
