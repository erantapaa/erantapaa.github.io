When you're [D]weary, [G] feeling [D]small  [G]
When [C]tears [G]are [D]in your e[Em]yes
I will d[D]ry them all [G    D    G    D](all)
[D]I'm [A]on [G]your [A]side, o[A7]h, when times get ro[D]ugh

<verse>
When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you (ooo)
I'll take your part, oh, when darkness comes
And pain is all around
</verse>

<p>(Chorus)

<verse>
Sail on silver girl, sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
Oh, if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
</verse>

<verse>
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
</verse>
