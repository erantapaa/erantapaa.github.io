[C]When your legs don't work
    like they [F]used to before  [G]
[C]And I can't sweep you off of your [F]feet  [G]
[C]Will your mouth still remember
    the [F]taste of my love  [G]
[C]Will your eyes still smile from your [F]cheeks  [G]
</verse>

<verse>
And darling [C]I will be loving [F]you
    '[G]til we're seven[C]ty  [F]   [G]
And baby [C]my heart could still fall as[F]
    hard[G] at twenty-[C]three  [Am7]
[F]And I'm thinking [G]'bout how
    [Dm]people fall in love in mys[G]terious [C]ways
[Dm]Maybe just the touch of a [G]hand
Oh [Dm]me I fall in love with you ever[G]y single [Am]day
An[Dm]d I just wanna tell you I a[G]m
So honey now...[C   F]

<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse>
Take me [G]into your loving [C]arms  [F]
Kiss me [G]under the light of a [C]thousand stars  [F]
Place your h[G]ead on my beating [C]heart
I'm thinking [F]out lou[G]d
Maybe [Am]we fo[G]und lo[F]ve [C]right w[F]here [G]we a[C]re

<verse>
When my hair's all but gone
    and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play
    the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same
</verse>

<verse>
'Cause honey your soul can never grow
    old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in
    my mind and memory
</verse>

<verse>
I'm thinking 'bout how
    people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now ...
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS) So baby now... (CHORUS)

<verse>
Oh maybe [Am]we fo[G]und lo[F]ve [C]right w[F]here [G]we a[C]re
And [Am]we fo[G]und lo[F]ve [C]right w[F]here [G]we a[C]re
