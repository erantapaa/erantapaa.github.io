<p><i>Capo 4</i>

<h3>VERSE 1</h3>

<verse>
[D]My Grandpa gave a wheat penny and I [G]kept it in my [D]pocket
[D]I had big plans in my back yard to [A]build me a space rocket
[D]I talked to my brother on a fake CB that I [G]made from a tic-tac [D]box
[D]I packed my snowballs nice and tight but in the [A]middle I put r[D]ocks
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>

<verse>
[G]Don't trade in your tic-tac box for a ball on the end of a [D]chain
And don't go spending Grandpa's pennies buying into the [A]game
You gotta [G]keep your heart [D]young
[A]Don't go growing old be[Bm]fore your time has come
You can't take [G]back what you have [D]done
You've gotta [A]keep your heart [D]young
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>
<verse>
[D]Dad took the wheels off of my bike and he [G]pushed me down a [D]hill
But speed got the best of me and [A]I took my first thrill
[D]That was back when alcohol was [G]only used on [D]cuts
It stung like hell so I jerked my leg and momma [A]said it'd give me [D]guts
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS)

<div class="keep-together">
<h3>VERSE 3</h3>
<verse>
So take a picture of the one you love and [G]put it in a [D]locket
Go dig up your time capsule and the [A]blue prints for your rocket
[D]Keep in touch on a fake CB, that [G]same old tic-tac [D]box
Pack your snowballs a little less tight but in the [A]middle still put [D]rocks
</verse>
</div>

<h3>BRIDGE</h3>
<verse>
And [G]keep your heart [D]young
[A]Don't go growing old be[Bm]fore your time has come
You can't take [G]back what you have [D]done
You've gotta [A]keep your heart [D]young
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS)

<verse>
You gotta [G]keep your heart [D]young
Some[A]times you don't die quick
Just [Bm]like you wished you'd done
The [G]love is a loaded [G]gun
You've gotta [A]keep your heart [D]young
You can't take [G]back what you have [D]done is [Bm]done
You've gotta [A]keep your heart [D]young
</verse>
