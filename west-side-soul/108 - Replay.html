Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay

Remember the first time we met
You was at the mall wit you friend
I was scared to approach ya
But then you came closer
Hopin' you would give me a chance
</verse>

<verse>
Who would have ever knew
That we would ever be more than friends
We're friends worldwide, breakin' all the rules
She like a song played again and again
</verse>

<verse>
That girl, like somethin' off a poster
That girl, a dime they say
That girl, is a gun to my holster
She's runnin' through my mind all day, ay

See you been all around the globe
Not once did you leave my mind
We talk on the phone, from night til the morn
Girl you really change my life
Doin' things I never do
I'm in the kitchen cookin' things she likes
</verse>

<verse>
We're friends worldwide, breakin' all the rules
Someday I wanna make you my wife
That girl, like somethin' off a poster
That girl, a dime they say
That girl, is the gun to my holster
She's runnin' through my mind all day, ay

Oh girl I could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come baby girl let's sing with me
Ay, I can be your melody

The one that could fill your fantasies
So come baby girl let's sing with me
