<verse>
Let's get d[D]own to [G]business,
To de&mdash;[Am]feat the Huns
[Em]Did they s[D]end me d[G]aughters,
When I [Am]asked for [D]sons?
You're the sad[C]dest bunch I ev[D]er met
But you can bet[G] before we're thro[C]ugh
Mister, I'[C]ll make a ma[D]n out of you  [Em]
</verse>

<verse>
Tranquil as a forest but on fire within
Once you find your center,
You are sure to win
You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow I'll make a man out of you
</verse>

<verse>
[C]I'm never gonna ca[D]tch my breath
[B]Say goodbye to those who knew me  [Em]
[D]Boy, was I a fool in sc[G]hool for cutting [C]gym
[C]This guy's got 'em [D]scared to death
[B]Hope he doesn't see right t[Em]hrough me
[D]Now I really wish that [G]I knew how to [C]swim
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse>
Be a m[C]an
We must be s[D]wift as the cour[G]sing river
Be a m[C]an
With all the f[D]orce of a gr[Em]eat typhoon
Be a m[C]an
[C]With all the st[D]rength of a ra[B]ging f[Em]ire
[C]Mysterious as the d[D]ark side of the [Em]moon
</verse>

<verse>
Time is racing toward us till the Huns arrive
Heed my every order and you might survive
You're unsuited for the rage of war
So pack up, go home, you're through
How could I make a man out of you?
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS x2)
<!--
Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon
