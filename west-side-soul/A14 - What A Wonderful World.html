<h3>VERSE 1</h3>
<verse two-line>
       C        Em     Am        Em
I see trees of green, red roses too
Dm         C       E7         Am     
I see them bloom, for me and you,
      F             Dm         G          C     G
And I think to myself, What a wonderful world.
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>
<verse two-line>
      C        Em        Am        Em
I see skies of blue and clouds of white,
Dm                 C        E7           Am
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night,
      F             Dm         G          C
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
</verse>

<h3>BRIDGE</h3>
<verse two-line>
    G                         C
The colors of a rainbow are so pretty in the sky
G                       C
Are also on the faces of people going by
        Am             Em          Am         Em
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
Am             Em    Dm   C   G
They're really saying I love you.
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 3</h3>
<verse two-line>
       C      Em     Am           Em
I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
Dm              C             E7        Am
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know,
      F                G               C
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
      F             Dm         G          C
Yes I think to myself, what a wonderful world.
