<h3>VERSE 1</h3>
<verse>
I'm packed a[G]nd I'm holding 
I'm smiling, she'[D]s living, she's golden[C] 
And she lives for me 
She says she lives [G]for me 
Ovation 
She's got her[D] own motivation 
[C]She comes round and she [G]goes down on me 
And I make[D] her smile 
It's like a[C] drug for you 
Do ever what you want to do 
Coming [G]over you 
Keep [D]on smiling, what we go through 
[C]One stop to the rhythm that divides you 
[G]And I speak[D] to you like the cho[C]rus to the verse 
Chop another line like a c[G]oda with a curse 
And I come on[D] like a freak sho[C]w takes the stage 
We give them the games we play, she said 
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse>
[G]I want[D] somet[C]hing else 
To get me th[G]rough this 
[D]Semi-charmed [C]kind of life 
[G]I want[D] someth[C]ing else 
I'm not listening when y[G]ou [D]say 
[C]Good-bye 
</verse>
<p><i>Doo-doo-doo   doo-doo-doo-doo</i>

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>
<verse>
The sky it was gold, it was rose 
I was taking sips of it through my nose 
And I wish I could get back there 
Some place back there 
Smiling in the pictures you would take 
Doing crystal myth 
Will lift you up until you break 
It won't stop 
I won't come down, I keep stock 
With a tick-tock rhythm and a bump for the drop 
And then I bumped up 
I took the hit I was given 
Then I bumped again 
And then I bumped again 
</verse>

<div class="keep-together">
<h3>REFRAIN</h3>
<verse>
How do I get back there to 
The place where I fell asleep inside you? 
How do I get myself back to 
The place where you said 
</verse>
</div>

<p>(CHORUS)
<!--
<verse>
I want something else 
To get me through this 
Semi-charmed kind of life 
I want something else 
I'm not listening when you say 
Good-bye 
</verse>
-->

<h3>VERSE 3</h3>
<verse>
I believe in the sand beneath my toes 
The beach gives a feeling 
An earthy feeling 
I believe in the faith that grows 
And the four right chords can make me cry 
When I'm with you I feel like I could die 
And that would be all right 
All right 
</verse>

<h3>BRIDGE</h3>
<verse>
When the plane came in 
She said she was crashing 
The velvet it rips 
In the city we tripped 
On the urge to feel alive 
But now I'm struggling to survive 
The days you were wearing 
That velvet dress 
You're the priestess, I must confess 
Those little red panties 
They pass the test 
Slide up around the belly 
Face down on the mattress 
One 
Now you hold me 
And we're broken 
Still its all that I want to do 
Feel myself with a head made of the ground 
I'm scared but I'm not coming down 
And I won't run for my life 
She's got her jaws just locked now in smile 
But nothing is all right 
All right 
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS 2</h3>
<verse>
I want something else 
To get me through this life 
I want something else 
I'm not listening when you say 
Good-bye
</verse>

<h3>OUTRO</h3>
<verse>
The sky it was gold, it was rose 
I was taking sips of it through my nose 
And I wish I could get back there 
Some place back there
In the Place you used to start
</verse>
