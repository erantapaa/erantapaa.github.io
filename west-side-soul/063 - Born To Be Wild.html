<h3>VERSE 1</h3>
<verse two-line>
Em      A         E
Get your motor runnin'
G       A          E
Head out on the highway
Em       A         E
Lookin' for adventure
G       A         E
And whatever comes our way
</verse>

<verse two-lines>
G     A         E
Yeah Darlin' go make it happen
G        A          E
Take the world in a love embrace
G    A           E
Fire all of your guns at once
   G    A        E
And explode into space

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>
<verse>
I like smoke and lightning
Heavy metal thunder
Racin' with the wind
And the feelin' that I'm under
</verse>

<verse>
Yeah Darlin' go make it happen
Take the world in a love embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse two-line>
       E
Like a true nature's child
        G
We were born, born to be wild
       A
We can climb so high
G             Em
I never wanna die
E          D    A  E
Born to be wild
E          D    A  E
Born to be wild
</verse>
