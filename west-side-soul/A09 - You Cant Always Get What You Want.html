C                      F
I saw her today at the reception
  C                    F
A glass of wine in her hand
  C                              F
I knew she was gonna meet her connection
       C                    F
At her feet was a footloose man
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse two-line>
    C                         F
You can't always get what you want
    C                         F
You can't always get what you want
    C                         F
You can't always get what you want
           D
But if you try sometimes, 
  F
You might find
                 C              F    C       F
You get what you need...   ahhhhhhh, yeah.....
</verse>

<verse>
I went down to the demonstration,
To get my fair share of abuse.
Singing "we're gonna vent our frustration,
And if we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse."
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS)

<verse>
I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescription filled.
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy,
And man, did he look pretty ill.
</verse>

<verse>
We decided that we would have a soda,
My favorite flavor, cherry red.
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy,
And he said one word to me, and that was "dead,"
I said to him:
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS)

<p>[Instrumental]

<verse>
You'll get what you need--yeah, oh baby.
</verse>

<verse>
I saw her today at the reception,
In her glass was a bleeding man.
She was practiced at the art of deception,
Well I could tell by her bloodstained hands.
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS x2)
