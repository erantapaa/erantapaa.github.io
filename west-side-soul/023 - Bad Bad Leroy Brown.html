<h3>VERSE 1</h3>

<verse>
Well the [G]South side of Chicago
Is the [A7]baddest part of town
And if you [B7]go down there
You better [C]just beware
Of a [D7*]man named [C]Leroy [G]Brown  [D7]
</verse>

<verse>
Now [G]Leroy more than trouble
You see he [A7]stand 'bout six foot four
[B7]All the downtown ladies call him [C]"Treetop Lover"
All the [D7*]men just [C]call him [G]"Sir"  [D7]
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>

<verse>
And it's [G]bad, bad Leroy Brown
The [A7]baddest man in the whole damned town
[B7]Badder than old King Kong
And [D7*]meaner than a [C]junkyard [G]dog   [D7]
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>

<verse>
Now Leroy he a gambler
And he like his fancy clothes
And he like to wave his diamond rings
In front of everybody's nose
He got a custom Continental
He got an Eldorado too
He got a thirty two gun in his pocket for fun
He got a razor in his shoe
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 3</h3>

<verse>
Now Friday 'bout a week ago
Leroy shootin' dice
And at the edge of the bar
Sat a girl named Doris
And oo that girl looked nice
Well he cast his eyes upon her
And the trouble soon began
And Leroy Brown learned a lesson
'Bout messin' with the wife of a jealous man
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 4</h3>

<verse>
Well the two men took to fighting
And when they pulled them off the floor
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle
With a couple of pieces gone
</verse>

<p>CHORUS x 2

<h3>OUTRO</h3>

<verse>
Yes, you were [B7]badder than old King [C]Kong
And [D7*]meaner than a [C]junkyard [G]dog.
</verse>
