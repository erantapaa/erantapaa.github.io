<h3>VERSE 1</h3>
<verse>
My [A]child arrived just the [C]other day;
He [D]came into the world in the [A]usual way.
But there were [A]planes to catch, and [C]bills to pay.
[D]  He learned to walk while I [A]was away.
And he was [G]talkin' 'fore I [G/F#]knew it.  And [Em7]as he grew  [Em/D]
He'd say, [C]"I'm gonna [Em/B]be like [A]you, Dad.  You [C]know I'm gonna [Em/B]be like [A]you."
</verse>

<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse>
And the [A]cat's in the cradle and the [G]silver spoon,
[C]little boy blue and the [D]man in the moon.
"[A]When you comin' home Dad?" "I [G]don't know when, but [C]we'll get to[Em/B]gether then[A], Son.
You [C]know we'll have a [Em/B]good time [A]then."
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>
<verse>
My son turned ten just the other day.
He said, "Thanks for the ball, Dad.  Come on, let's play.
Can you teach me to throw?"  I said, "Not today.
I got a lot to do."  He said, "That's okay."
And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed.
It said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah.  You know I'm gonna be like him."
</verse>

<h3>VERSE 3</h3>
<verse>
Well, he came home from college just the other day,
So much like a man I just had to say,
"Son, I'm proud of you.  Can you sit for a while?"
He shook his head and he said with a smile,
"What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys.
See you later.  Can I have them please?"
</verse>

<h3 class="page-break">VERSE 4</h3>
<verse>
I've long since retired, my son's moved away.
I called him up just the other day.
I said, "I'd like to see you if you don't mind."
He said, "I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time.
You see, my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu,
But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad.  It's been sure nice talkin' to you."
</verse>

<verse>
An[D]d as I [A]hung up the [Bm]phone it oc[A]cured to me,
He'[G]d grow[Bm]n up just [E]like me.
My [G]boy [Bm]was just [E]like me.
</verse>

IMHO, this is a better version that the simplified version that was/is on
ftp.nevada.edu.

TAB: each space represents an eigth note

The music says CAPO 8 (key of F) but I usually play it CAPO 5 (key of D),
since that's in my range.
