<h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
<verse>
Like a small b[G]oat
On the ocean
Sending big w[Em7]aves
Into motion
Like how a single [Cadd9]word
Can make a heart open
I might only have o[G]ne match
But I can make an exp[D]losion
</verse>

<verse>
And all th[G]ose things I did[Cadd9]n't say
Wrecking ball[Em7]s inside my br[D]ain
I will s[G]cream them loud to[Cadd9]night
Can you [Em7]hear my voice this ti[D]me?
</verse>

<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
<verse>
This is my fi[G]ght song
Take back my l[D]ife song
Prove I'm alr[Em7]ight song  [Cadd9]
My power's turn[G]ed on
Starting right now I'll [D]be strong
I'll play my fi[Em7]ght song
And I d[Cadd9]on't really care if nobody else [D]believes
'Cause I've [Cadd9]still got a lot of fight left in [G]me
</verse>

<h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
<verse>
[Em7]Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
[Cadd9]Everybody's worried about me
[G]In too deep
Say I'm [D]in too deep (in too deep)
[Em7]And it's been two years I miss my home
But there's a fi[Cadd9]re burning in my bones
And I [G]still believe
Yeah, I st[D]ill believe
</verse>

<verse>
And all those th[G]ings I didn't [Cadd9]say
Wrecking bal[Em7]ls inside my br[D]ain
I will sc[G]ream them loud ton[Cadd9]ight
Can you [Em7]hear my voice this ti[D]me?
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS)
<!--
<verse>
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
</verse>
-->

<verse>
A lot of fight left in [G]me
</verse>

<p>(VERSE 1 to "explosion")
<!--
<verse>
Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion
</verse>
-->

<p>(CHORUS)
<!--
<verse>
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong (I'll be strong)
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
</verse>
-->

<verse>
Know I've [Cadd9]still got a lot of fight left in [G]me
