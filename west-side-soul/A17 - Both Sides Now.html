<verse>
[G]Rows and [Am]flows of [C]angel [G]hair
And ice cream [Bm]castles [C]in the [G]air
And feather [C]canyons every[Am]where
I've [C]looked at clouds that [D]way
</verse>

<br/>
<verse>
But [G]now they [Am]only [C]block the [G]sun
They rain and [Bm]snow on [C]ever[G]yone
So many [C]things I [Am]would have done
But [C]clouds got in my [D]way
</verse>

<br/>
<verse>
I've [G]looked at [Am]clouds from [C]both sides [G]now
From [C]up and [G]down and [C]still some[G]how
It's [Bm]cloud's il[C]lusions [G]I recall
I [C]really don't know [D]clou[Dsus]ds      [D]   at [G]all  [G  C  G  C x2]
</verse>

<br/>
<verse>
[G]Moons and [Am]Junes and [C]Ferris [G]wheels
The dizzy [Bm]dancing [C]way you [G]feel
As every [C]fairy [Am]tale comes real
I've [C]looked at love that [D]way
</verse>

<br/>
<verse>
But [G]now it's [Am]just a[C]nother [G]show
You leave 'em [Bm]laughing [C]when you [G]go
And if you [C]care, don't [Am]let them know
Don't [C]give yourself a[D]way
</verse>

<verse>
I've [G]looked at [Am]clouds from [C]both sides [G]now
From [C]up and [G]down and [C]still some[G]how
It's [Bm]cloud's il[C]lusions [G]I recall
I [C]really don't know [D]clou[Dsus]ds      [D]   at [G]all  [G  C  G  C x2]
</verse>

<br/>
<verse>
[G]Tears and [Am]fears and [C]feeling [G]proud,
To say "I [Bm]love you" [C]right out [G]loud
Dreams and [C]schemes and [Am]circus crowds
I've [C]looked at life that [D]way
</verse>

<br/>
<verse>
But [G]now old [Am]friends they're [C]acting [G]strange
They shake their [Bm]heads, they [C]say I've [G]changed
Well something's [C]lost, but [Am]something's gained
In [C]living every [D]day.
</verse>

<br/>
<verse>
I've [G]looked at [Am]clouds from [C]both sides [G]now
From [C]up and [G]down and [C]still some[G]how
It's [Bm]cloud's il[C]lusions [G]I recall
I [C]really don't know [D]clou[Dsus]ds      [D]   at [G]all  [G  C  G  C x2]
</verse>
