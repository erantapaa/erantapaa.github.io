<h3>VERSE 1</h3>
<verse>
At f[Am]irst I was afraid, I was p[Dm]etrified
Kept thinkin' [G7]I could never live without you [Cmaj7]by my side
Then I s[Fmaj7]pent so many nights thinking [Bm7b5]how you did me wrong
And I grew st[E]rong, and I learned h[E7]ow to get along
</verse>

<verse>
And so you're back from outer space.
I just walked in to find you here
Without that look upon your face.
I should have changed that fucking lock.
I would have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me. 
</verse>

<h3>BRIDGE</h3>

<verse>
Oh now go.
Walk out the door.
Just turn around now.
You're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
</verse>

<div class="keep-together">
<h3>CHORUS</h3>

<verse>
Oh not I. 
I will survive.
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll be alive.
I've got all my life to live.
I've got all my love to give.
I will survive.
I will survive. 
</verse>
</div>

<h3>VERSE 2</h3>
<verse>
It took all the strength I had
Just not to fall apart.
I'm trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart.
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself.
I used to cry.
But now I hold my head up high. 
</verse>

<verse>
And you'll see me with somebody new.
I'm not that stupid little person
Still in love with you.
And so you thought you'd just drop by,
And you expect me to be free.
But now I'm saving all my lovin'
For someone who's lovin' me. 
</verse>

<p>(To BRIDGE AND CHORUS)
