           A      
If I had a hammer,
                      A
I'd hammer in the morning,
                  A       
I'd hammer in the evening,
              E7
All over this land,
                A   -A7
I'd hammer out danger, 
                 D       D7
I'd hammer out a warning,
                   D      A
I'd hammer out the love between
   D               A
My brothers and my sisters
D-A-E7        A      E7
All over this land.  Oh, oh . . .
</verse>

<verse>
If I had a bell
I'd ring it in the morning
I'd ring it in the evening
All over this land

I'd ring out danger
I'd ring out a warning
I'd ring out love between my brothers
And my sisters
All over this land, oh
</verse>

<br/>
<verse>
If I had a song
I'd sing it in the morning
I'd sing it in the evening
All over this land

I'd sing out danger
I'd song of out a warning
I'd sing out love between
My brothers and my sisters
All over this land, oh
</verse>

<verse>
Well, I've got a hammer
And I've got a bell
And I've got a song to sing
All over this land

It's the hammer of justice
It's the bell of freedom
It's a song about love between
My brothers and my sisters
All over this land
