<p><i>Capo 1st fret</i>


<verse two-line>
    A
I'm sitting in the railway station.
      Amaj7                  A7    F#
Got a ticket for my destination, mmmm
Bm                               G
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.
    A                                  E7               A
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and one-man band.
</verse>


<h3>CHORUS</h3>
<verse two-line>
         D            A
Homeward bound,  wish I was,
         D
Homeward bound,
A             Asus4
Home where my thought's escaping
A             Asus4
Home where my music's playing,
A             Asus4
Home where my love lays waiting
E           A
Silently for me.
</verse>


<verse two-line nochords>
A
Ev'ry day's an endless stream
   Amaj7               A7      F#
Of cigarettes and magazines, mmmm
    Bm                                  G
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
    A                             E7                       A
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS)

<verse two-line nochords>
  A
Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
     Amaj7                 A7     F#
I'll play the game and pretend, mmmm
    Bm                              G
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
     A                      E7                      A
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.
</verse>

<p>(CHORUS)

<h3>OUTRO</h3>

<verse two-line>
Amaj7       A7       A
  Silently for me.
